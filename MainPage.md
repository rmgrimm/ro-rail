# Introduction #

Rampage AI Lite (RAIL) is a complete rewrite of Rampage AI from the ground up. It is written with the intent of being faster and more efficient. In addition, this rewrite takes into account the changes in Ragnarok since the last release of Rampage AI (eg, Mercenaries, Alchemist-skill removal, etc). More information can be found on the [Project Home](http://code.google.com/p/ro-rail/) page.
